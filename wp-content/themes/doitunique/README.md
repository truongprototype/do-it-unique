# DoitUnique WordPress Theme

## Setting up the Site Icon (Favicon)

The theme is already configured to use the icon in the `assets/images/icon.png` file as a fallback favicon. However, for the best results across all devices and browsers, you should set the Site Icon through the WordPress admin interface:

1. Log in to your WordPress admin dashboard
2. Go to **Appearance > Customize**
3. Click on **Site Identity**
4. Scroll down to the **Site Icon** section
5. Click on **Select site icon**
6. Upload the `icon.png` file from the theme's `assets/images` directory
7. WordPress will automatically generate all the required sizes and formats
8. Click **Publish** to save your changes

This will ensure that your site has the proper favicon across all devices and browsers.

## Additional Theme Features

- The theme supports custom logos which can be set through the same **Site Identity** section in the Customizer.
- Permalink structure is automatically set to post name.
- Upload folder structure is set to not use year/month folders for better media organization.
